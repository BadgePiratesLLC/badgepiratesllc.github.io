This is quick How do I make a new post.

1. Create new file
2. Add Title Blocks at top:
---
layout: post

---
3. Name as date then title <YYYY-M-D-Title.md>
  *note* - dont put the Date info in and it wont publish, so can be used as Drafts
4. Commit and then wait


To add a photo do
![Title](URL Link)
Files can be stored in the Image Direcotry in this respository and then you only need to link via </images/Filename>
