.PROJECT TITLE: SNOWFLAKE LTS<br>
This project was a pet project of myself (fg). I wanted to create a Learn to Solder kit (LTS) that BadgePirates could
use as a basic and or advanced kit for use at conferences were we run Learn to Solder villages. I thought it would be cool to 
have something people could make and then hang around the house, in this case on a christmas tree. Noting that each year
familys pull out those orniments that little jimmy make of his hand in plaster or paper pictures with a year froms school. Well
why not the LTS kit that Sussie made at her first hacker con that one year. Maybe badge pirates would live long into the future
after we are all dead and gone.

.CURRENT VERSION<br>
The current version here is a Through Hole version that uses 5mm LED's, a CR2032 battery, with a power switch.
Unique with this is that 2 snowflake board can be joined together to make a 3d like snowflake.

<br>
.FUTURE VERSION<br>
- Keep an eye out for a Suface mount version with SMD LED's. 
- maybe a version that only turns on in low light?
- Maybe a version with IOT (why not)
