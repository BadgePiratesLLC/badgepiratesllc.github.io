title: BSidesKC 2019 SAO

![Title](/images/BSides21_Badge.jpg)
The Badge: This is actually pivot number 3 for the BSides KC 2021 Badge, with supply chain issues we attempted to pivot our original plan to a different BOM but still had
issues with availability of parts so we had to come up with a "non-electronic" style badge. What we ended up with was the intention of having a Badge that you could
sit on your desk and display SAO's (shitty Add ons). This gave us the ability to still create something unique that was "electronic-ish" and work with those components
that we could with the supply chain woas of the year. The design allowed for up to 12 SAO's to be fitted on the Badge.

 The SAO's: This year we had a Covid Style SAO for each version.
 Participant - White
 Speaker - Blue
 Vendor - Green
 Volunteer - Red
 Village - Purple
 Organizer - Black
 
 Each SAO contained just the SAO connector and 2 Reverse mount (Gulwing) LED's. 
 
 Additional SAO's: Along with the Con SAO's you may have seen a few special SAO's which included
 RF Village
 Sponsor - Wirex
 Sponsor - Sumo Logic
 Sponsor - Cerner

 Badge Stand: The intent was to provide a Stand that would allow the badge to stand on your desk (or book shelf / workbench) and as an addition provide power via a
 5v USB Cable. Although we provided the stands we did not have any that actually provided power with populated components. There is a write-up here <URL>, but expect
 an updated version in the future.

 The Game: As with most of the Badge Pirates projects, Yes .. there was a game associated with this one too. You may have noticed some simple code on the back of a
 few of the SAO's. Game Instructions [here **Spoilers**](http://challenges.cryptochallenges.com/BC/2021/BSides21.html)
 
 Future: The current plan is in the future to provide addition year SAO's for Participant versions that you can display on your SAO display Badge. Keep an eye out.
