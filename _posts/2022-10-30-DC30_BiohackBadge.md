.PROJECT TITLE<br>
Biohacking Village DefCon 30 Badge
<br><br>
.CURRENT VERSION<br>
Introducing our contribution to the Defcon 30 Biohacking Village Badge. In designing this badge we wanted
a throwback to our childhoods and designed a badge around the operation game of our youth (yeah we are old), 
but with a modern twist. In keeping with the throwback (and due to supply chain uncertianty) we tried to design
without an MCU. This design also found us venturing into a new design iption with using acrylic sandwiched between
boards to allow the "cavities" to hold the "body parts" that you will be picking up with the tweezers and trying not
to trip the life hearts. 3 Strikes and you are out here.
