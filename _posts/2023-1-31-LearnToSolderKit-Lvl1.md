.PROJECT TITLE<br>
Learn to Solder Kit - Level 1
<br><br>
.CURRENT VERSION<br>
Introducing our Level 1 learn to solder kits. These Kits are the first in a series of Learn to
Solder projects we will be fielding to introduce you to and advance your soldering skills. In 
this level 1 kit you will learn the basics of soldering while using through hole components which
when combined will allow you to turn on a LED by pushing its corresponding button. Instructions for 
assembling the kits are printed on the back of the PCB. Also you will find a diagram of a through
hole LED which must be wired correctly for the circuit to work properly. 
<NOTE> since the LED's are the last to be solder on (IF you follow the directions) you can manually
  add them BEFORE soldering to test the circuit is working properly. I suggest trusting our instructions
  BUT VERIFY by testing the LED before you solder.
