Ahoy, Badge Pirates and BSidesKC Crew! 🏴‍☠️

We wanted to share an important update regarding the BSidesKC 2024 Badge orders.

⏳ Current Status:
The badges are currently still held at U.S. Customs. We're actively working through the process, but unfortunately, the delay is outside of our control.

📧 What Happens Next:
Once the badges are cleared and in our hands, we will email everyone who purchased a badge using the email address you provided at BSidesKC during registration.

🏴‍☠️ Pickup or Shipping Options:
In that email, you’ll be able to choose:

Local Pickup:

At SecKC

At BSidesDSM

Shipping Option:

We'll collect your shipping address if you prefer to have the badge mailed to you.

🙏 Thank you for your patience and support while we work to get these delivered to you! We can’t wait for you to have them in your hands — they’re worth the wait!

Fair winds and clear customs,
– The Badge Pirates Crew
