I. Introduction <br>
Now that you have the CactusCon 11 badge in your possession, you are probably wondering where you can find more information about its impressively crafted design. Allow me to reassure you that you have arrived to the correct location to find such information. This year's Badge was the result of a joint effort on the part of the Badge Pirate (that would be us) and the CactusCon personnel.

II. The Layout and Construction of the Badge<br>
As you can see, efforts were made in the design of the badge to adhere to the convention's theme, which was the "Nightmare house" with "IOT" or "Home Automation." This eventually resulted in the artwork that is shown on the exterior as the Angry House. And in addition to the motif, the badge contains built-in technologies that make it possible to communicate as an Internet of Things device with the ability to integrate and automate your house.

III. Technical Details<br>
The design is centered around an ESP32-S2 WROOM Microcontroller to give control over the Badge and all of its functionalities. This MCU not only supplied Wi-Fi connectivity but also had the capacity to operate the GPIO ports that were used for the 2 Reverse mounted RGB LEDs light up the Angry houses top windows, additional 3 RGB Neopixels, A single LED which lights the front "drone", 5 input buttons, and OLED outputs that were included on the device. Along with the built-in components, we have provided pin outs for the remaining GPIO pins. These pins could be used to add other components or functionality as you see fit. We have also provided a development board, which was available at the Hardware hacking village. So, go on and hack to your heart's content! 
Access to the MCU can be done via the USB Connection through a USB to Serial (CH340N) Chip. Alternatively you can directly connect with UART to the D+ and D- pins, or with JTAG (if you are fiesty enough). With a little more hacking new firmware can be pulled wirelessly as it was done during the con. We will leave this up to your hacking skills by looking at the code to replicate the Convention Infrastructure for that initial connection. 

IV. Conclusions and Remarks<br>
As expected, we did run into the inevible supply chain issues throughout the production of this badge, as we do with all of the other recent badges, but we were able to overcome them. We sincerely hope that you have as much pleasure in using it as we did in conceiving and constructing it. Special Thanks goes out to the entire CactusCon Crew and we hope to see you next year with another exciting badge.
