# 📢 BSidesKC Badge Delivery Update

Ahoy, BSidesKC Attendees and Crew! 🏴‍☠️

We’re excited to share an update on the **BSidesKC 2025 badges**!

✅ We’ve received some of the badges through U.S. Customs, and we’re preparing to begin distribution.

📬 **What happens next?**  
An email has been sent to everyone who purchased a badge, using the email address provided at registration during BSidesKC.

In that email, you’ll be asked to choose how you’d like to receive your badge:

- Pick up locally at upcoming events like **SecKC** or **BSidesDSM**
- Or provide your **shipping address** so we can mail it directly to you

📅 The deadline to respond is **June 1st**... so please check your inbox (and spam folder!) and get your preferences in.

We appreciate your patience and support... we’re stoked to finally start getting these badges into your hands!
