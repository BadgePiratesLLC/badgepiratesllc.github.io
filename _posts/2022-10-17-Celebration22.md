.PROJECT TITLE<br>
Celebration Handout Anaheim 2022 - (grogu)

.CURRENT VERSION<br>
This was made for the Star Wars Celebration 2022 in Anaheim CA. It was used as a handout and traded
for other swag. It consisted of a CPB Designed as grogu, witth reverse mount LEDs which lit up his eyes.
Instead of using pins as we have before, these had small cell phone charm cords which allowed it to hang 
from lanyards, or other items. Although tese were handouts, you can purchase on our tindie shop while supplies last.
