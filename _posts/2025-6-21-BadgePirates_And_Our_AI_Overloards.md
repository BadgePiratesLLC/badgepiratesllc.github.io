# How Badge Pirates Uses AI (and Why It’s Not What You Think)

If you’ve been watching the AI buzz lately, you might think every company is run by robots these days. “AI-generated badges?!” Nah, that’s not quite how it works here.

At Badge Pirates, we *do* use AI — but probably not in the way you’re imagining. Most of what we do is still powered by creativity, caffeine, and a lot of late-night debugging. What we *have* done is use AI and automation to work smarter and move faster... especially when things get hectic before a big conference.

Let’s break it down.

## Automation ≠ AI (and Why That Matters)

First, let’s clear something up: **automation and AI are not the same thing**.

- **Automation** is when we write scripts or build systems that follow specific rules. Think: auto-generating shipping labels, sorting files, compiling firmware, or scheduling tweets.
- **AI**, on the other hand, is when we use tools that *learn*, *adapt*, or *interpret language/code/art* in flexible ways — like ChatGPT, Copilot, or image generators.

So yes, we automate a LOT — but we also use AI where it actually makes sense.

## Where AI Actually Shows Up in Our Workflow

### Articulating Ideas (AKA “Making Me Sound Smarter”)

I’ll be honest: I suck at writing. But I’ve got ideas — tons of them. And AI helps me take the chaotic mess in my head and turn it into something you’d actually want to read... like this post.

Tools like ChatGPT help me:
- Draft newsletters and blog posts
- Refine documentation
- Translate “Kevin-ramble” into clear instructions for collaborators

It’s like having an editor who doesn’t mind working at 3AM.

### Programming + Troubleshooting

We also use AI coding assistants to:
- Get quick explanations when something breaks
- Speed up writing boilerplate or repetitive code
- Translate logic across platforms (like from Arduino IDE to PlatformIO)
- Experiment with new features or hardware integrations

AI doesn’t replace understanding... but it *does* make it easier to move fast and catch problems early. Think of it like a very polite junior dev who doesn’t get tired.

### Design + Logistics

On the logistics side, AI helps us:
- Parse and reformat Tindie order exports
- Generate packing slips and shipping labels
- Organize complex badge firmware by event/year
- Forecast how many parts to order based on past sales and current trends

Again — this is *mostly automation*, but AI helps bridge the gaps where things get fuzzy, like:
- Detecting address formatting issues
- Estimating box sizes based on order contents
- Creating cleaner internal workflows

## So... Is AI Designing Your Badge?

No. **We are.** Every badge still starts with human ideas — from theme to artwork to features. But AI helps remove friction, whether that’s solving a code bug, outlining a new project, or just getting a second opinion on layout ideas.

In short: **AI helps us think clearer, code faster, and ship smarter.**

And when it’s midnight before a con and we’re still assembling badges... we’ll take all the help we can get.

## Have Questions?

Curious how we actually use these tools behind the scenes? Want a deeper dive into our process or the specific tech we rely on?

Drop us a line — we’re always happy to nerd out and share more.  
Better yet, track us down at Hacker Summer Camp this summer (Black Hat / DEF CON) and ask us in person.
